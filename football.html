                             <p>Former BC RB Andre Williams, a 2014 fourth-round pick, enticed the Giants so much. But entering his third season, he has less than 1,000 rushing yards to his name and eight TDs. Will he break out?</p>

                           <p>The New York Jets and quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick remain at least $5 million apart in their contract negotiations, according to Chris Lopresti of WFAN. The Jets reportedly have a front-loaded offer on the table for the quarterback over the next two seasons with an average value of $10 million per season.</p>

                            <p>Tight end Tyler Eifert was a big part of the Cincinnati Bengals' offensive success last season, and the team may be without him at the start of the 2016 season. Eifert had ankle surgery to address an injury he suffered in the Pro Bowl, and although it is described as a "minor procedure," the recovery time is three months. ESPN's Adam Schefter is reporting that Eifert may miss the first couple of games of the season.</p>
