                             <p>NEW YORK — Kia NBA Most Valuable Player Stephen Curry of the Golden State Warriors and forward LeBron James of the Cleveland Cavaliers lead the 2015-16 All-NBA First Team, the NBA announced today. Curry is the only player to receive First Team votes on all 129 ballots, earning First Team honors for the second straight year. James (125 First Team votes) has been named to the First Team for the 10th time in 13 seasons, tying seven players for the second-most selections in NBA history.</p>

                             <p>Stephen Curry celebrated early reports of his second consecutive MVP award by pouring in 40 points, including an NBA record 17 in overtime, to carry the Warriors to a dramatic comeback win over the Blazers. The victory pushed Golden State to a 3-1 edge in the second-round series, while Curry’s individual play marked perhaps the most iconic performance of his career as he returned from a knee sprain in spectacular fashion.</p>

                             <p>After starting the season with 24 straight wins, the Golden State Warriors capped their historic 2015–16 campaign with a 73rd win in their finale, breaking the '95–96 Bulls' record for the best regular season in NBA history. But will it all be for naught if the defending champions can't win a second straight title?</p>

                            <p>The members of the three All-NBA teams were announced Thursday, with one costly omission. Pelicans forward Anthony Davis, who would have earned a $24 million bonus if he was named to an All-NBA team, did not receive enough votes for inclusion. </p>

                           <p> In 1999, Kellogg's released a special edition of Cocoa Frosted Flakes with NBA Rookie of the Year Vince Carter on the cover. Raptors fan Andy Pyne bought a box and kept it for nearly two decades. Pyne made a bet three years ago that he'd eat the cereal if the Raptors ever made it to the ECF. Kyle Lowry delivered a stunning performance in Game 7 to lead Toronto to a series against the Cavaliers, and Pyne kept his word.</p>
